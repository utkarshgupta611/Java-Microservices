# BookHive-CapstonProject
## Book Hive

 Book hive Corp. is a leading publishing house in the US. The company headquarter is located in Atlanta. It has been publishing books, articles, journals, novels, magazines, and encyclopedias for the past fifteen years. The customers of the company include students, IT professionals, and research scholars. The company enjoys a dominant position in the publishing business with 15 retail stores in all major cities in the US.
Presently, the company depends on the print and electronic media to advertise its books. There is a static website that is periodically updated whenever a new book is released. Many competitors of the company already have their e-commerce stores and are selling books online. Book hive is losing its customers to competitors because people prefer buying books online, without having to visit a retail store. Customers often complain that due to an inadequate number of stores in their city, they have to travel a long distance to reach a store. In addition, customers visiting a store complain that, at times, the books that they are looking for are not available in the stores.
Hence, many orders remain unplaced and customers are dissatisfied. As a result, there has been a loss in the company's revenue.



 ## The Proposed System
It is evident that the existing business model is insufficient to meet customer demands.
To address the current limitations, the management has tied up with a software development organization. The management has instructed the organization to create an online book store application that can be globally used to order books. In the first phase, the Book hive application will simplify the process of managing stocks and enable the organization to sell books online. The application should provide a consistent mechanism to enable customers to buy books online and administrators to manage book stocks online. Currently, the management wants that all orders should be processed at a centralized location and delivered through the relevant store. Later, each store will have its own interface through which it will be able to manage the orders pertaining to that store.
To provide the envisioned functionalities, the Book hive application should have the following features during
